Basic structure and body of html. Main tags 
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides a structure and layout for the content on a webpage, using a series of tags and attributes to define the different elements of the page. The most common elements include headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML can be used in conjunction with other languages like JavaScript and CSS to create more complex and dynamic web pages.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. It is most often used with HTML to create visually appealing web pages and user interfaces. CSS allows developers to separate presentation and content, making it easier to maintain and update web pages.
